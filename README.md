# Linear Regression Model
I made this basic model for linear regression with pytorch while I was in training at the Centre for Applied AI at Sheridan College.
This helped me understand deeper about the process of training a model and the course I was doing on youtube about ML alongside helped me gain deeper understanding of Machine Learning, its types and differences from Deep Learning.

I am currently working with a team of 6 Researchers on a multi-modal CNN model for Deception Detection in collaboration with Karmy Clinic. I am working with tools like OpenFace and Azure Kinect SDK for that project.
